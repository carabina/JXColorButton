# JXColorButton
A custom color well button with a custom popover menu of colors to replace NSColorWell. Plays nicely with the OS X color picker for custom colors.

To use a JXColorButton, simply drop a custom view in and set its class to JXColorButton and implement the JXColorButton delegate on your view controller or window controller. :)

You can customize the colors, dark/light background vibrancy of the popover, menu text, coloring, spacing, selection highlight colors, and a host of other options. The code is well documented, tested on OS X 10.11 (although it needs more testing), and written in Swift 2.

The example project demonstrates how easy it is to setup a button, customize its appearance, and handle the message it receives.
